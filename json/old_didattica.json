        "The complexity of large-scale distributed systems, particularly when deployed in physical space, calls for new mechanisms to address composability and reusability of collective adaptive behaviour. Computational fields have been proposed as an effective abstraction to fill the gap between the macro-level of such systems (specifying a system’s collective behaviour) and the micro-level (individual devices’ actions of computation and interaction to implement that collective specification), thereby providing a basis to better facilitate the engineering of collective APIs and complex systems at higher levels of abstraction. This paper proposes a full formal foundation for field computations, in terms of a core (higher-order) calculus of computational fields containing a few key syntactic constructs, and equipped with typing, denotational and operational semantics. Critically, this allows formal establishment of a link between the micro- and macro-levels of collective adaptive systems, by a result of computational adequacy and abstraction for the (aggregate) denotational semantics with respect to the (per-device) operational semantics."

These systems tend to feature large scale, heterogeneity of communication model (including opportunistic peer-to-peer wireless interaction), and require inherent self-adaptiveness properties to address unforeseen changes in operating conditions. In this context, it is extremely difficult (if not seemingly intractable) to engineer reusable pieces of distributed behaviour so as to make them provably correct and smoothly composable.",

On the one hand, functional properties are addressed by identifying the largest-to-date field calculus fragment generating self-stabilising behaviour, guaranteed to eventually attain a correct and stable final state despite any transient perturbation in state or topology, and including highly reusable building blocks for information spreading, aggregation, and time evolution. On the other hand, dynamical properties are addressed by simulation, empirically evaluating the different performances that can be obtained by switching between implementations of building blocks with provably equivalent functional properties. Overall, our methodology sheds light on how to identify core building blocks of collective behaviour, and how to select implementations that improve system performance while leaving overall system function and resiliency properties unchanged."

Each end-user is characterized by a maximum possible reception rate that depends on the distance and on the interface used to communicate with the associated access point. The end-user satisfaction is proportional to the actual rate received. The overall end-user satisfaction is the sum of the satisfaction of each end-user. Our goal is to maximize the overall end-user satisfaction under the constraint that the access points can retransmit at different rates the same common content at most $K$ times.",

When the access points and the end-users have a unique interface, the optimal segmentation can be found in $O(N(K + \\log ⁡N))$ time by exploiting the convex Monge property of the satisfaction function. When both access points and end-users are equipped with multiple interfaces, the problem becomes computationally intractable, even for a single access point. Polynomial time algorithms are then devised for optimally solving some meaningful particular cases."

In this position paper we argue, by means of simple examples, that aggregate computing is particularly well suited for implementing  distributed monitors.

On the other hand, these competitions can be more appealing both for average students, valuing group membership more than personal accomplishments, and most importantly, teachers: team achievements are more recognizably linked with the overall school or teacher performance than solitary excellences, resulting in increased returns rewarding the involved subjects."

Based on the classical notion of <i>event structure</i>, we introduce the <i>cone Turing machine</i> as a ground for studying computability issues, and first use it to prove that field calculus is <i>space-time universal</i>. We then observe that, in the most general case, field calculus computations can be rather inefficient in the size of messages exchanged, but this can be remedied by an encoding to nearly similar computations with slower information speed. We capture this concept by a notion of <i>delayed space-time universality</i>, which we prove to hold for the set of message-efficient algorithms expressible by field calculus. As a corollary, it is derived that field calculus can implement with message-size efficiency all self-stabilising distributed algorithms."

This foundation has been elaborated into a layered approach to engineering coordination of complex distributed systems, building up to pragmatic applications through intermediate layers encompassing reusable libraries of provably resilient program components.

In this context, a key building block for large-scale system coordination, called gradient, is used to estimate distances in a fully-distributed way: it is the basis for a vast variety of higher level patterns including information broadcast, events forecasting, distributed sensing, and so on. However, computing gradients is very problematic in mobile environments: the fastest self-healing gradient conceived so far (called <i>BIS</i>) achieves a reaction speed proportional to the single-path speed of information in the network. In this paper we introduce a new gradient algorithm, <i>SVD</i> (Stale Values Detection) gradient, which uses broadcasts to reach a reaction speed that is equal to the multi-path speed of information, namely, the fastest speed possibly achievable by network algorithms. We then combine <i>SVD</i> with other blocks (metric correction, smooth filtering, <i>BIS</i> gradient, information damping) proposing a composed block called <i>ULT</i>(imate) gradient. We evaluate the resulting algorithm and compare it with other approaches, showing it scores best both on accuracy and smoothness while keeping communication cost under control."

In this paper, we investigate the interplay between interaction and restriction: known as \"domain alignment\" in field calculus, it is extremely powerful but can cause subtle bugs when not handled properly. We propose a disciplined programming approach based on the interplay between a weak and a strong version of alignment, mixing static and dynamic checks. This is exemplified to design a new reusable component dynamically updating the strategy by which a device can extract information from neighbours, which find applications, for instance, in the on-the-fly evolution of metrics in smart mobility applications."

        "We consider the problem of allocating $N$ uniform data to $K$ transmission channels so as the average Expected Delay (AED) is minimized. This problem arises in designing efficient data-diffusion broadcast algorithms in a smart environment. We show that the basic dynamic rogramming algorithm for solving the uniform pallocation problem can be spedup up to $O(NK)$ time by applying an optimal algorithm to find the row-minima of totally monotone matrices. Such a new algorithm is always faster than the best previously known algorithm for the uniform allocation problem that runs in $O(NK \\log N)$. Moreover, it is computationally optimal for the uniform allocation of up to $N$ data and $K$ channels. We then reduce the largest allocation problem, i.e., the subproblem with exactly $N$ data and $K$ channels, to the problem of finding a minimum weight $K$-link path in a particular directed acyclic graph. We also present two heuristics and we show by extended simulations their effectiveness in practical scenarios. Both the $K$-link path algorithm and the heuristics are much faster than $O(NK)$. We then compare the behaviours of our algorithms on the online version of the allocation problem in which new single items are inserted for broadcast."

        "Changing the teaching of informatics in secondary (and primary) education is in many countries difficult to achieve, owing to several reasons: the natural tendency of institutions and people to stick to well-established practices, a distorted view of informatics prevailing in society and among those who take the decisions, the specific fact that in several school systems the teaching of informatics is largely committed to teachers of other scientific disciplines. We describe the Italian situation and our experience in Turin where we have organised training stages for the Olympiad in Informatics and supported the organisation of other informatics contests. On its basis we argue how the different kinds of competition can help to change informatics education in Italy, by making problem solving and programming play a central role."

        "Le Olimpiadi Italiane di Informatica (OII) sono una realtà nazionale e internazionale che coinvolge studenti e docenti delle scuole superiori e non solo, e ruota intorno ad alcune competizioni di problem-solving che si svolgono a più livelli. Uno sguardo disattento potrebbe quindi concludere che questa manifestazione coinvolga un numero troppo esiguo di persone (proprio in quanto competizione) per avere un impatto dal punto di vista educativo, e che sia svolta a un livello troppo prematuro (data la giovane età dei partecipanti) per avere un impatto dal punto di vista del progresso scientifico. Tuttavia, entrambe queste conclusioni sono inesatte e trascurano molti aspetti del progetto che trascendono le singole gare di cui è composto. Come approfondiremo meglio più avanti, le OII sono infatti un’occasione di ritrovo oltre che una competizione; e come tale hanno avuto il ruolo di mettere in rete scuole del territorio e docenti, promuovendo e dando visibilità all’entusiasmo degli insegnanti che in questo modo hanno trovato occasioni pubbliche per confrontarsi con ragazzi e colleghi in altre scuole e nelle università. Ognuno dei docenti e dei ragazzi che ha partecipato alle OII ha fatto ritorno a casa con un nuovo bagaglio di esperienze e contatti, ha esteso gli effetti di questa manifestazione nel proprio territorio a persone che non vi hanno partecipato direttamente promuovendo così, in modo trasversale ma sempre guardando ai giovani, le conoscenze informatiche così importanti ai giorni nostri. D'altro lato, evidenze statistiche mostrano come buone prestazioni a livello di problem-solving (e in particolare di Olimpiadi di Informatica) si traducano, anni dopo, in maggiori probabilità di lavorare in campo informatico sia nella ricerca pubblica che in aziende private, contribuendo in questo modo allo sviluppo della materia. Ma il ruolo delle Olimpiadi non si ferma all’individuazione delle eccellenze, fornendo visibilità, borse di studio o contatti. Quello che è molto più importante, e che genuinamente caratterizza le OII, è che esse forniscono a ragazzi dotati di talento una possibilità di raggiungere consapevolezza dei propri interessi e delle proprie capacità, fornendo così una motivazione e occasioni di miglioramento che difficilmente potrebbero verificarsi lungo un programma didattico uniformato, che spesso non li spinge a superare i propri limiti. In questo articolo ci proponiamo di presentare le Olimpiadi di Informatica in Italia descrivendone la struttura, illustrando il tipo di competenze coinvolte e riportando testimonianze dirette di docenti e studenti che hanno attivamente partecipato a questo progetto, con l’attenzione volta soprattutto a riferimenti ed esempi che possano essere utili per chi si avvicina alle OII per la prima volta."

        "Questo libro è stato pensato come supporto per lo studente che intende prepararsi per le olimpiadi della matematica, e cerca una solida base di teoria prima di affrontare i problemi proposti. Resta comunque accertato il fatto che, per ottenere buoni risultati alle olimpiadi, sia assolutamente necessario allenarsi con molti esercizi, per creare un occhio attento a discernere le diverse tipologie e strategie risolutive. Gli argomenti teorici richiesti dalle olimpiadi della matematica sono, in buona parte, al di fuori dell’attuale programma ministeriale; eppure siamo convinti che possano essere di grande aiuto per lo sviluppo di una mentalità scientifica, deduttiva e creativa. Abbiamo quindi cercato di rivolgere questo libro ad un pubblico di studenti il più ampio possibile, conservando un’impostazione rigorosa ma rinunciando ad ogni inutile formalismo ed evidenziando in particolar modo gli aspetti applicativi. Per iniziare un allenamento di tipo pratico, abbiamo inserito alcuni esercizi alla fine di ogni capitolo, di cui una parte con soluzione proposta nella parte finale del fascicolo; molti altri se ne possono trovare in [2], [3] e [4], raccolte di problemi proposti effettivamente in sede olimpica. Abbiamo scelto, alla fine di ogni capitolo, di segnalare alcuni esercizi presi da queste fonti, citando semplicemente la gara e il numero di esercizio corrispondente (nei riferimenti a [4]), o il codice numerico (nei riferimenti a [2] o [3]). Inoltre, tra le novità della nuova edizione, ogni capitolo si introduce con un problema, in modo tale da far ambientare subito il lettore con l’argomento, e accontentare i più desiderosi di passare subito alla pratica. Infine abbiamo inserito, per chi fosse particolarmente interessato e volesse spingersi un po’ oltre quelle che possono essere le ambizioni di base, alcuni paragrafi di approfondimento, nei quali vengono introdotti e affrontati alcuni argomenti più impegnativi e meno comuni, ma che possono comunque risultare utili nella risoluzione di problemi olimpionici, in particolare nelle fasi più avanzate della gara.

        "As the density of sensing/computation/actuation nodes is increasing, it becomes more and more feasible and useful to think at an entire network of physical devices as a single, continuous space-time computing machine.  The emergent behaviour of the whole software system running on top is then induced by local computations deployed within each node and by the resulting information diffusion dynamics. A relevant example of this distribution model is given by <i>aggregate computing</i> and its companion language <i>field calculus</i>, a minimal set of purely functional constructs used to manipulate distributed data structures evolving over space and time, and resulting in robustness to changes.",
        "In this paper, we study real-time characteristics of aggregate computing and field calculus, providing an analytic result linking the quality of the output of an aggregate computation to the amount of computing resources dedicated. We apply this procedure to the archetypical and widely-used case of aggregate computation called <i>gradient</i>: a fully-distributed estimation of distances over a metric space by a spanning tree. The resulting error bounds are then exploited for network design, suggesting an optimal density value taking broadcast interferences into account. Finally, an empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithms is performed validating the theoretical results and showing that the average performance is much better than the worst-case bounds previously obtained."

        "The driving motivation to embark in the researches presented in this book has been the following: give a satisfactory sound explanation rooted in mathematical logic for the success forcing axioms have met in settling so many problems formalizable in third order arithmetic. Most of these problems are otherwise undecidable on the basis of ZFC alone. Why forcing axioms have been so successful? We believe that the results of part VI provide a solid mathematical explanation: strong forcing axioms yield as a natural byproduct strong generic absoluteness results for third order arithmetic. This occurs much in the same way as large cardinal axioms do for second order number theory. Therefore large cardinals and forcing axioms transform forcing from a tool to prove independence results into a tool to prove theorems. Moreover the axiom of determinacy AD plays a crucial role in providing a new powerful tool to settle most of the questions on second order arithmetic which are independent from ZFC; likewise Martin’s maximum plays the same role for third order arithmetic as AD does for second order arithmetic. We do not want to dwelve further on this theme here; the motivated reader is referred to [53], the introductory parts of [3, 51, 52], and (for a more technical set of results) to the results of Chapter 8."

While there are several monographs where forcing is introduced by means of boolean valued models, to our knowledge no detailed account of iterated forcing following a boolean algebraic approach has yet appeared. We believe that this different approach is fruitful since the richness of the algebraic language simplifies many calculations and definitions, among which that of RCS-limits.
